# HPlus-Sport
A company site in which I added various features to the products section using jQuery. Features include:
- dynamic CSS manipulation so that groups of products are styled consistently
- displaying particular products based on the state of checkboxes
- creating a dynamic internal page that displays relevant product information using query string parameters, JSON, and AJAX
